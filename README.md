# Gatsby Theme Soundcloud

Get a homepage for your song!

This is a pretty simple plugin to get a page for your soundcloud song. It uses the config object to programatically build pages. These pages will be at the sluggified title, i.e, title `Places + Faces` will be at route `{basePath}/places-faces`.

## Install

```bash
yarn add @rttnbrgr/gatsby-theme-soundcloud
```

or

```bash
npm i @rttnbrgr/gatsby-theme-soundcloud
```

## Config Options

Setup the plugin in `gatsby-config.js` with the rest of your plugins.

```js:title=gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: '@rttnbrgr/gatsby-theme-soundcloud',
      options: {
        // All options go in the soundcloud key
        soundcloud: {
          // optional path for all your pages
          basePath: 'my-songs',
          // an array of track objects
          tracks: [
            {
              artist: 'Amine', // name of the artist
              title:  'Places + Faces', // name of the track
              url:    'https://soundcloud.com/heyamine/places-faces' // link to soundcloud track page
            }
            ...
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Roadmap
This is the shitty first draft of an idea I have had for a while. 
I've got some ideas for what this could turn into, but nothing solid.

Bug me on twitter if you have thoughts or file an issue.
